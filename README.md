# Math Modeling Practice

> *Record our trace of practices*  

This repository collects our practice works, codes, and documents for mathematical modeling competitions.  (including 2014A,2021B,2022B,2023B,2024B)
We aim to **record the entire process of thinking, modeling, coding, and reflecting**, so that future us (and anyone interested) can revisit the path we have taken.
